### Q_23

Write a complete C++ program that has a main function, an
AskForTwoNumbers function, and a FindBigOne function. The main calls the
AskForTwoNumbers function, which asks the user for two integers. These two
integers are �returned� to main, and are then sent to FindBigOne. It returns
the larger value to main. For example, if the user puts in 19 and 2,FindBigOne
will return 19. If the two numbers are the same, it will send back either one.

### Q_24

Write a program that declares variables and pointers for a double, float, int, and
short int (eight total variables). Assign values of your choosing to the numeric
variables and the addresses of the variables into their pointers. Write out the addresses
and values of each variable. Use the sizeof operator to state the number
of bytes reserved for each type of variable.Then, using pencil and paper, diagram
a memory using boxes that represent how the program allocated the memory.
