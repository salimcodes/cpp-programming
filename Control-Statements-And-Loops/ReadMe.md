### Q_38

Write a complete C++ program that asks the user for a number between 0 and
100 (0 and 100 are out of range). If the number is between 1 and 9, write out the
words ONE DIGIT BIG! If it is between 10 and 99, write out the words TWO
DIGITS BIG! If the user�s number is outside the requested range write the
phrase OUT OF RANGE. Your program should use an if�else/if�else
control structure, not three individual if statements.


### Q_39

Write a complete C++ program that asks the user to enter a date in the
month/day/year format, such as 4/25/2007. Check to ensure that the date is
valid. (Remember, thirty days hath September,April, June, and November. All
the rest have thirty-one, except in leap year, once in four, when February has
one day more.)1 If the date is valid, state that, as well as convert it to the day
number in the year. For example, January 31 is the thirty-first day of the year,
and February 1 is the thirty-second day of the year. Determine if the year is a
leap year. Recall that a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4�except
in century years, which are leap years only if they are divisible by 400. If the
date is not valid, write a �not valid� message.



### Q_41

Write a complete C++ program that converts distance values. The program
should give the user three options: convert a whole number of inches to feet
and inches, convert feet and inches to decimal feet or feet and inches to inches.
For example, 80 inches is 6 feet, 8 inches; and 5 feet, 6 inches is 5.5 feet and 4
feet, 2 inches is 50 inches.Write the decimal feet to three decimal places.


### Q_51

The C++ Distillery produces an excellent whiskey that is blended from a combination
of mash and corn, aged in oak barrels for at least two years.The whiskey is
filtered through charcoal and bottled in clear two liter triangular-shaped bottles.

We�re going to write a program to help our distillery owner order the correct
number of bottles for his product.The oak barrels are cylindrical in shape and
range in size. Ask your user to enter the name for the whiskey that is going to
be bottled, the size and number of barrels, and their diameter and height (in
inches).We�ll assume the barrels are all the same size.Approximately five percent
of the volume is lost during the aging and filtering process. Once you have
the barrel information, calculate the amount of whiskey to be bottled and the
number of bottles required for this batch of whiskey. Bottles come to the distillery
in cases of twelve, so also report the number of cases our owner should
order. Remember, 231 cubic inches is a gallon and a gallon is equivalent to
3.785 liters.

Fuel efficiency is on everyone�s mind these days. We�re going to write a program
to help the car buyer analyze the expected price of driving her new car.
This program presents the user with a list of five types of cars and their expected
miles per gallon (mpg). We�ll ask her to select two of the vehicles and
enter the number of miles driven each year. Also enter the average price for a
gallon of gas.The program then reports the yearly total number of gallons required
by each vehicle, total cost, and shows the difference in cost between the
two vehicles. The program should use two vectors, one for the type of vehicle
and the other for integers that hold the corresponding mpg values.
